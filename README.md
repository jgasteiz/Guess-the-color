#Guess the color

###_so you think you are a hardcore web developer..._

Guess the color is a supersimple-afternoon-made game for hardcore web developers.

I've considered the possibility of using flask for a simple ranking system and also to generate images for the colors. Currently cheating is very easy, so it would be pointless to create a ranking without the generated images.
